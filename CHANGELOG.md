* Added composite formatting and a subset of format specifiers to logging statements for integer types. Standard numeric format specifiers included are `DdXx`, custom numeric format specifiers are `0#,.\` and string literals enclosed by `''` or `""`.
* SourceGenerator's code refactoring.
* Log.* calls are generated even if no usage is detected to improve auto-completion

* SharedStatic alignment added to fix the crash on ARM
* Omitted message near non-omitted one cause wrong codegen
* Reserved argument names parsed incorrectly
* Crash in some cases when a user calls Log. from non-main thread first (so cctor is called on non-main thread)
* HideInStacktrace now works for burst's directcalls

### Security

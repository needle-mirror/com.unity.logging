# Documentation for pre-release versions of com.unity.logging

Because of idiosyncrasies with which Unity packages are published, it may be possible to see the documentation for the 1.0.0 version of `com.unity.logging` before the package itself is available.  Should you find yourself in that situation, we've made the [pre-release documentation](images/com.unity.logging@1.0.zip) available.  This offline archive contains a snapshot of documentation for the 1.0.0-pre.65 version.
